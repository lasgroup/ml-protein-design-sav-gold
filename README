Further resources
-----------------
A large part of the dataset could not fit to the repository. Additional data is located in
1. Embeddings form the `/data` can be downloaded from [here](polybox).
2. NGS sequencing analysis can be downloaded from [here](polybox). 
3. 10% subset of structured can be downloaded [here](polybox). 
4. Pretrained and saved models for the plotting can be found [here](polybox).

How setup the code?
---------------
The easiest way to rerun the clode is to clone repository along with the stpy repository as
